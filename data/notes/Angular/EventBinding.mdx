Event binding allows us to listen to events like button click,submission of forms etc.

The syntax of event binding is event name in lowercase enclosed in `()` and an `=` pointing to a function name.

Example:

`App.component.html`

```html
<button (click)="showLog()">Show log</button>
```

`App.component.ts`

```ts
//snip

showLog(){
console.log("Hello World")
}
```

This will show a button with `Show log` as text and will console log `Hello World` once clicked.
