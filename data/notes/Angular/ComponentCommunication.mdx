An Angular application consist of many components and to make them work together  We've to communicate with each component.

Their are 4 ways to Communicate between Components:

1. Binding Using `@Input` and `@Output` decorator.
2. Reference using `@ViewChild` and `@ContentChild`
3. Provider ( Services )
4. Template Outlet.


### Binding 
`@Input` decorator takes data from Parent Component and pass it down to the child component.

To Demonstrate Binding we will create Two Components named `parent` and `child`

```bash
ng g c parent
```

```bash
ng g c child
```

In our Child Component, we will import `Input` from `@angular/core` and write the following code:

```ts
import {Component,OnInit,Input} from '@angular/core'
// snip
export class ChildComponent implements OnInit {
	@Input() 
	message!:string

	//snip

}

```

In Component's Html we will render this value:
```html
{{message}}
```

In Parent Component We will render the Child Component using :
```html
<app-child></app-child>
```

To Pass the `message` from parent to child component we've to use:

```html
<app-child [message]="'Hello World From Parent Component'"  ></app-child>
```

To Render the Parent Component we will use `app-parent` selector in our `app.component.html`

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<app-parent></app-parent>
```

Output in the Dom:

`@Output` decorator marks a property in a child component as a doorway through which data can travel from Child to Parent Component. 

In Child Component Import `Output` and `EventEmitter` decorator.

Create a new Variable with the following Code:

```ts
// snip
@Output() messageEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

	sendMessage(){
		this.messageEvent.emit("Hello From Child Component.")
	}
```

Child's Template:

```html
<button (click)="sendMessage()" > Click Here </button>
```

In Parent Component's file create a function to recieve the message:

```ts
// snip

	recieveMessage(msg:string){
		console.log(msg)
	}

```

Parent's Template:

```html
<app-child (messageEvent)="recieveMessage($event)"></app-child>
```
