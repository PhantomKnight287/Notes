Text Interpolation is a one way data binding Technique which is used to transfer data from a Typescript code to an Html Element. It uses `Template Expression ({{}})` also known as Moustache Syntax.

### Use of Text Interpolation

We uses Text Interpolation when we want to show a dynamic data in our component

To use Text Interpolation we uses `{{}}` .

Angular will resolve the code present inside these braces.

### Things We cannot do in TextInterpolation

1. Use of Operators involving Some Sort of Assignment like: `=` `+=` `-=`
2. JavaScript KeyWords like `new` `typeof` `instanceof`
3. Chaining Expressions
4. Increment and Decrement Operators like: `++` `--`
5. Some ES2015+ operators.

Text Interpolations can also Invoke Functions:

Example:

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",

  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",

  styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"],
})
export class AppComponent {
  getMin(a: number, c: number) {
    if (a > b) return b;
    return a;
  }
}
```

Inside The Template:

```
	{{getMin(2,3)}}
```

Output:

# Things to Remember when using TextInterpolations

1. We should keep the Application logic in `.ts` file as much as possible.
2. Expressions should finish quickly for better and faster user experience.
3. Template Expressions should not change the Application's State.
