React Hooks were first introduced in v16.7.0-alpha.

React team refered to them as 
`Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.`

Hooks:
1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext
4. useReducer
5. useCallback
6. useMemo
7. useRef
8. useImperativeHandle
9. useLayoutEffect
10. useDebugValue

The Hooks are used to create a stateful component. It enables us to perform some operations during component's lifecycle. It lets you have a state and update the UI when the state updates.

React team isn't planning to remove Classes.
