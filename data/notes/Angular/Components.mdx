Components are **the most basic UI building block of an Angular app**. An Angular app contains a tree of Angular components. Angular components are a subset of directives, always associated with a template. Unlike other directives, only one component can be instantiated for a given element in a template.

# Creating a Component

We can create a new angular component by two ways.

1. Using Angular cli
2. Creating on your own.

#### Creating A component using Angular cli

```bash
ng generate component <name>
```

Or

```bash
ng g c <name>
```

Angular Cli will take care of rest of the things like including your component in `app.module.ts`

#### Creating A Component Manually.

1. Create a new file in `app` directory ending with `.component.ts`
2. Add the following code to your component file.

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-test-component",
  templateUrl: "./app-test.component.html",
  styleUrl: "./app-test.component.css",
})
export class TestComponent {}
```

Understanding The Component:

1. We're importing `Component` from `@angular/core`
2. Adding a `Component` decorator. Decorator marks a class as an Angular component and define meta data about the component.

`selector` in the class decorator is a special tag. It will be used to apply css to the element and render this component.

`templateUrl` is a property which points to a `html` file for the component.
`styleUrl` is a property which points to a `css` file for the component.

We can also use `template` and `styles` to define our component iand styles in the same file without creating css and html files.

All the properties defined in the class of the Component is available in the Component and we can access them using `{{}}`.

Import the Class(TestComponent) in `app.module.ts` and provide it in `declarations` in `@NgModule` decorator.

To Render the Component use

```html
<app-test-component></app-test-component>
```

**Example:**

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-test-component",
  templateUrl: "./app-test.component.html",
  styleUrl: "./app-test.component.css",
})
export class TestComponent {
  title = "Hello World";
}
```

We can access this title property in component's template using `{{title}}`
