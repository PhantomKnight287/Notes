Events in React follows Camel Case which means `onclick` in Html is `onClick` in React.

# Handling Events In Functional Components

```js
export default function Component() {
  return (
    <>
      <button>Click Here</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

This is a basic functional component displaying a button in the dom.

We want to listen to the click event on the button and show an alert with Text `Hello World`

```js
export default function Component() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    alert("Hello World");
  };
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Here</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

&rarr; We should not pass the function as a function call (ex: `handleClick()` instead of `handleClick`) as it will call the function when the component is rendered and nothing will happen when the button is clicked afterwards. We can add Arrow Functions as event handlers.

# Handling Events in Class Component

```js
import { Component } from "react";

export default class ClassComponent extends Component {
  handleClick() {
    alert("Hello World");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Here</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
