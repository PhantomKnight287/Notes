We will Create our First React Application using `create-react-app`

Make sure you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

Prefix these commands with `sudo` if you're on a Mac or Linux.
```bash
npm install -g npx
```
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

This command will create basic React Application in `my-app` directory.

The folder structure will look something like this:
<img src="/data/notes/react/CRA.png" alt="React Structure" />


Start the Application using `npm start`

The application will be running on localhost:3000

The default application will look something like this
<img src="/data/notes/react/basicApp.png" width="500px" alt="Default Application" />
