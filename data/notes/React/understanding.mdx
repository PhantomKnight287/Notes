We Created A React Application using CRA. Open `index.js` file present in `src` folder

The default code will be like this:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```

# Understanding Each Line

1. Importing React from `react` package. This is no longer needed since React v17.
2. Importing ReactDOM from `react-dom` package. This package helps us to render our application.
3. Importing `./index.css` file. This file contains all the styles for our application.
4. Importing `./App.js` file. This file contains the code for our application.
5. Importing `./reportWebVitals` function. This function helps us to measure performance of our application.

The Main Logic of Rendering is inside `ReactDOM.render` function.

This function takes two arguments.

1. The JSX element to render and 2. The DOM element to render it in.

The JSX element must have one single parent tag.
The `<App />` is the JSX element. The JSX elements can be render just like Normal HTMl Elements.

We're getting a dom element using `document.getElementById` function. The `root` is the id of the element.
