It is easy to Create Angular project using Angular cli.

Angular Cli also helps us to create `components`,`services` etc.

To install Angular cli:

```bash
sudo npm i -g @angular/cli
```
remove sudo if you're on windows.

To create an Angular Application:

```bash
ng new <name>
```

This will ask you few questions and create a new Application in new directory.

The default file structure of the Angular looks like this:
