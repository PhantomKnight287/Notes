Pipes are just functions in your template which you can use to accept an input value and return a formatted value.

Example:

Creating a new variable in our component with name `date` and value set to `new Date()`.

If we render it in our component this is what we get:

![image](/data/notes/angular/Date.png)

To get formatted date in our Component we can use `date` pipe.

The syntax to use pipes is

```html
{{ <var> || <pipe-name> }}</pipe-name></var>
```

To use Date Pipe:

```html
{{ date | date }}
```

Here First `date` is the variable and second `date` is the date pipe.

If we now see the output it will be this:

We can create our own pipes using `Angular Cli`
To Create a new Pipe use:

```bash
	ng g p <name>
```

We will create a pipe called `greetings`

Default code in the generated file:

```ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from "@angular/core";

@Pipe({
  name: "greetings",
})
export class GreetingsPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: unknown, ...args: unknown[]): unknown {
    return null;
  }
}
```

Here `Pipe` and `PipeTransform` is already imported. The `name` property in `@Pipe` decorator is the name of the pipe which we can use in own template.

In Our Pipe's Class `PipeTransform` is already implemented, this needs our class to have a `transform` function which will recieve a value passed from the component.

In our case it will be a string so we can change the type from `unknown` to `string` for parameter `value` and function's return type.

We will return the string `Hello <name>`.
