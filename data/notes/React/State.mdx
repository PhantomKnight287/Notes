# Some Important Points about State and Props.

Props:

1. Props are Passed to the Component by its Parent Component.
2. Props are immutable.
3. Accessing The Props
   - `props` &rarr; Functional Components
   - `this.props` &rarr; Class Components

State:

1. State is Managed within the Component.
2. State is mutable.
3. Access The State
   - `useState` hook &rarr; Functional Components.
   - `this.state` &rarr; Class Components.
4. Updating The State
   - Functional Component &rarr; a function returned by `useState` hook.
   - Class Components &rarr; `this.setState` function

Both of these are information which influences the UI in the browser.

# Creating a State in Class Component

```jsx
// Counter.js
import { Component } from "react";

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Count: {this.state.count}</div>;
  }
}
```

Output in the Dom:

<img src="/data/notes/react/countZero.png" alt="Counter Zero" />

Understanding The Component:

1. We're creating a Class `Counter` which extends the `Component` class of React.
2. In `render` function we're returing the JSX with `count : <counter>`.
3. In class's constructor we're calling the `super` function becauser we're extending the base `Component` class of React.
4. We're creating the state as an object this count set to 0. `state` is a reserved keyword in React's Component.

# Mutating the State in Class Component.

We can mutate the state in a Class Component using `this.setState` function. This function is provided to use by the `Component` class we extended. This function takes an object as an argument and set the object as state.

##### Updating the count in the Counter Component

```jsx
// Counter.js
import { Component } from "react";

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }
  increaseCount() {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Count : {this.state.count}</h1>
        <button onClick={() => this.increaseCount()}>Increase</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Clicking on the Button will increase the count.

Before Button Click:

<img src="/data/notes/react/countZero.png" alt="Counter Zero" />

After Button Click:

<img src="/data/notes/react/count1Button.png" alt="Counter Zero" />

# Creating a State in Functional Component

```js
// Counter.js
import { useState } from "react";
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Output in the Dom:

<img src="/data/notes/react/countZero.png" alt="Counter Zero" />

# Understanding the Component

1. We're Creating a `Counter` function.
2. We're using `useState` hook to create the count.
   - `useState` takes one parameter which is the default value of the `count` variable.
   - `useState` returns two things:
     1. Variable with the default value provided to `useState` parameter.
     2. A function to update the value of the variable.

# Mutating the State in Functional Component.

We can mutate the value of the state using the function returned by `useState` hook.

##### Updating The Count in Counter Component

```js
import { useState } from "react";
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increaseCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count : {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => increaseCount()}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Clicking on the Button will increase the count.

After Button Click:
