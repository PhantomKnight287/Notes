JSX &rarr; JavaScript XML - It is an extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like markup in JavaScript.

JSX elements have a tag name,attributes,and children.

A React Component without JSX

```js
import React from "react";
const Component = () => {
  return React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World");
};
```

Output:

<img src="/data/notes/react/helloWorld.png" alt="hello world" />

A React Component with JSX

```js
const Component = () => {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
};
```

Output:

<img src="/data/notes/react/helloWorld.png" alt="hello world" />

Difference between JSX and HTML

1. `class` attribute will be replaced by `className` because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
2. `for` in `label` will be replaced by `htmlFor` because `for` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
3. Camel Case Property naming Convention 
 - `onclick` will be changed to `onClick`
